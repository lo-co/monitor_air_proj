# Air Monitoring Project

This project is intended to run as a test for developing an embedded system, cross-domain project from the ground up.  It is intended to exercise:

* Documentation Maintenance
* Architectural Development
* Code Development
* Deployment

The intention is to use this as a jumping off point for testing other aspects of development including
* the use of queued message handlers for interprocess communication (Zero MQ, Rabbit MQ, etc)
* use of other languages such as rust for embedded development
* use of different RTOS'
* use of different SOC's (RPi, BBB, different MCUs, etc)
